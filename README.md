# Flourish

This is the frontend for the Flourish App, designed to help you track your plantsâ€™ fertilization schedule. Simply add a plant, start monitoring its care, and watch your plants thrive over time.

The frontend is currently under active development, with ongoing updates and feature enhancements. It is built using JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and the Vite framework.
